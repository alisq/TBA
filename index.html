<h4>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ARTIST PROJECT (150-200 words)</h4>
<p>(include context/conversation with the canon?)</p>



<h4>TOOL/EXERCISE (200-250 words max)</h4>
<p>Interview your neighbor about the place where they live. Ask them to share some interesting stories about their neighborhood and if they know about its past?</p>

<p>Based on your conversation, draw a picture of what your neighbor described. Do you remember all the details? How have you interpreted their memories of home? Does your drawing tell the same story or a new one? Share it with your neighbor and listen to how they respond.</p>


<h4>CONVERSATION/DISCUSSION POINTS (short questions)</h4>
<p>What objects or materials do you keep with you to be reminded of home?</p>
<p>How do you share the stories of those objects? Do you tell it with words, sing a song, do a dance, draw a picture, make a map, or some other way?</p>
<p>Can you share a story you know about Toronto? </p>
<p>How does your community hold on to memories of the past?</p>
<p>Which of those stories do you see around you in the city? And which are not brought to the surface?</p>
