A biennial is a large-scale, citywide contemporary art event that takes place every two years. The first was in 1895 with the inaugural Venice Biennale, an event that continues to showcase contemporary art in national pavilions from around the world. When effective, biennials can be sites of experimentation that offer artists, curators, and visitors an alternative to the traditional museum framework, all the while engaging flexibly with the local arts sector.  There are now over 100 biennials worldwide taking place in cities that include São Paolo, Berlin, Istanbul, and as of this year, the City of Toronto!
</p>

<p>
Toronto is not new to the grand exhibition. Exhibition Place, founded in 1879, has been home to many large-scale happenings within the City. This model has often showcased cutting-edge technological developments and industrial strength that proudly underscored the nation’s role in the conquest of land and colonial empire-building. The grand exhibition therefore has a darker history that audiences tend not to connect with contemporary biennial frameworks.  
</p>

<p>
As the first-ever contemporary art biennial in Toronto, we have the opportunity to critically reflect on these exhibition histories, while challenging ourselves to respond to more recent biennial tropes such as the gentrification of neighbourhoods and amount of waste produced in the production of large-scale events. This has brought us to ask: can contemporary exhibitions be more sustainable and aware of our responsibility toward surrounding communities and ecologies? This question has driven the Toronto Biennial of Art team within both its exhibition-making and public programming to develop responsive approaches that work in relation to the diverse histories of the City, the communities within it, and the water around it.
</p>

<p>
With this in mind, The Shoreline Dilemma seeks to address how industrial production and economic growth in Toronto have contributed to the historical and physical alteration of its waterfront due to dense condominium developments, active and decommissioned military bases, lost rivers, human-made spits, and rising tides. Following the Biennial’s core question to artists, “What does it mean to be in relation?”, humans or non-humans thinking and working in relation can reveal meaningful connections. Like the shoreline, the Biennial aims to move and shift in relation to its context, making space for flows of conversation and divergent experiences through exhibition-making and programming.

What tools do you need when visiting a biennial? Maybe a tool for making notes, for finding the way, for looking more closely, for resting. Tools can be used to help us make and repair, and sometimes also undo and break. Could a tool become part of making an experience? What tool would be useful for repairing a relationship? </p>

<p>
The word “tool” has been used in other ways. In Tools for Conviviality (1973), philosopher Ivan Illich looked into practical and political strategies to find ways people can access information to guide their own learning. Concurrently, activist and writer Audre Lorde called for new tools, noting: “[T]he master's tools will never dismantle the master's house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change.” More recently, architect Hélène Frichot’s imagining of “power tools” that can amplify silenced voices and histories recalls Métis artist and scholar David Garneau’s recognition of silence and non-verbal forms of expression and resistance as potentially more effective tools than words in conciliation and healing. </p>

<p>

Making, repairing, refusing, and undoing can take time. Tools for Learning adopts the approaches of these educators and thinkers, along with others inspired by Biennial participants and artworks. This growing toolbox includes tools for listening, agreeing or disagreeing, sharing and observing as a means to encourage learners to adjust, test, and experiment. Formed in response to the questions surfacing within the exhibition, these Tools offer a host of useful, bodily, and collective activities, which invite visiting schools, community groups, and others to make and repair—even undo and refuse—relationships among their curricula, experiences of the Biennial, and one another. ; F5
