",Forthcoming,"Breathing and Body Exercise
 

","Take note of where you are. Breathe. If you are able, stretch out your body and try to imagine the particular muscles you feel working. Or, if you prefer, remain as you are and focus on your breath. Relax. Take another deep breath. Become aware of how your body is positioned. As you sit, stand, or lie, take another deep breath and try to visualize your posture. Continue to breathe as you think about the following questions: How did you learn this posture? Who taught you? How do our bodies learn to do things? How do we use our bodies to learn? Take one last deep breath in this position and remember what you are doing with your body. Relax. Share with your neighbour what you noticed during the exercise and how you feel your body learns best. Together, imagine a space in which everybody could learn in their own way.","How do we use our bodies when we learn?

Courtesy the artist; Salon 94, New York; and Jessica Silverman Gallery, San Francisco",,Creating an Atmosphere,"Take a moment to feel the space around you. What is the temperature? How large does it feel to you? Does the space around you seem empty, crowded? Is it noisy, quiet? Where are you in the space? Are you able to be yourself in it? If you could do one thing to change the atmosphere of this space temporarily, what would it be? 

If it is changing the light in the space, try it. If it is making sound in the space, make it. If it is filling the space, invite others in. If it is moving in the space, give it a go. If it is slowing down the space, go slow. If it is stirring up the space, spread some joy. If it is quietening the space, just breathe. If it is leaving the space, find a way.

How did you choose to change the space you are in? Using a phone, camera, or other device, make a picture of the atmosphere you have created. From which point of view will you compose the picture? How will you frame the scene (what do you choose to leave in and leave out)? Do you need to add filters or layers to the image to help communicate more clearly? What is the atmosphere your picture creates?","How would you describe an atmosphere?
Can a picture show something that is usually not visible, like a feeling, memory, or sensation?
If you’re able, spend some time with Judy Chicago’s Atmospheres photographs. 
What atmosphere do these photographs create when you spend time with them?
Share with your neighbour what you see or feel. If words are not enough, try making a gesture or sound.",,CP (9/8/2019)
